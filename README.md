Round 0
Strategy Type: Pipeline Development & Data Ingestion
Focus: Building the core parsing, cleaning, and inspection codebase
Methods Used:
• Wrote a general-purpose parse_vec_general routine (regex‐based) to extract
floating-point vectors of varying lengths
• Loaded raw CSVs into df_raw, standardized column names, and captured a
pristine copy
• Assembled df_clean by dropping rows with malformed vectors or missing scores,
then validated dimensionality per function
• Implemented inspection helpers (inspect_clean, inspect_bad_in_raw) to report
usable‐row counts and vector dims
Model Used: None
Overview
In Round 0, before any black-box submissions, we focused entirely on establishing a reliable data
pipeline. We built and tested functions to:
1. Load heterogeneous CSV exports (handling shifted headers and stray columns)
2. Parse the InputVec field into numeric arrays of the correct length
3. Clean the data by dropping or imputing malformed/NaN entries
4. Inspect per‐function sample counts and dimensionalities to guarantee ≥1 valid row
for each F₁–F₈
This groundwork ensured that subsequent rounds’ optimization code could trust X, y shapes and
spot any upstream data issues early.
How we did?
• Parsed InputVec: Used a unified regex parser that handles dash-separated floats,
np.float64(...) wrappers, and padded short vectors to a fixed length.
• Built df_raw → df_clean: Copied the raw DataFrame, coerced Score to numeric,
applied parse_vec_general, then dropped any rows lacking a valid parsed vector or score.
• Validated Functions: Ran inspect_clean to confirm that every function F₁–F₈ had at
least one clean sample and recorded their dimensionalities.
• Logged Issues: Leveraged inspect_bad_in_raw to print out any dropped rows by
function and tally raw counts.

✅ Reason (Why We Did It)
Without a robust parsing and cleaning pipeline, any downstream model training or search logic
would risk silent failures or data corruption. We needed to guarantee that every subsequent round
could rely on correctly formatted vectors and scores.
✅ Approach (What We Did)
1. formats.
2. maximal usable data.
3. or inconsistent dimensions.
Parsing Logic: Wrote and tested a general parser to handle all known InputVec
Data Cleaning: Implemented rules to drop malformed entries while retaining
Inspection Tools: Created functions to surface any functions with too few samples
✅ Findings (What We Learned)
• Discovered header misalignments and stray “Unnamed” columns in multiple CSV
exports.
• Identified zero malformed rows in our first clean pass, but confirmed potential edge
cases for future import.
submissions.
• Verified that each function produced at least one valid sample, enabling Round 1
✅ Adjustments (How We Adapted)
• Standardized on a single, reusable parser and cleaning pipeline for all future
rounds.
• Logged all raw vs. cleaned counts to catch upstream data issues quickly.
• Prepared assemble_xy to stack parsed vectors into X and extract y for model fits in
Round 1.
Round 1
Round 3
Strategy Type: Mixed Exploration & Local Exploitation
Focus: Breaking plateaus for flat functions (F₁, F₇) while refining sensitive ones (F₂–F₅)
Methods Used:
• Random jumps: pure uniform sampling in [0,1]ᵈ for F₁ and F₇
• ±0.1 micro-perturbations: coordinate-wise tweaks around the then-best vectors for
F₂–F₅
Model Used: None (purely score-driven manual search)
Overview
In Round 3, we recognized that simple small tweaks weren’t enough to move the very flat
landscapes of F₁ and F₇. So we combined large random exploratory samples for those plateauing
functions with systematic ±0.1 coordinate perturbations for the more responsive functions (F₂–F₅).
This “global + local” hybrid let us both escape flat regions and hone in on promising basins.
How we did?
From the first block of eight scores in observations_round_3.txt, our best performers were:
• Best F₁: 1.3276592050304897e-69

🔍 RAFA Summary – Round 3 Observations Journey
✅ Reason (Why We Did It)
After Round 2’s format checks and small perturbations, F₁ and F₇ proved stubbornly flat; we
needed a mechanism to both escape those plateaus and continue fine-tuning the more sensitive
functions.
✅ Approach (What We Did)
1. regions for F₁ and F₇.
Random Exploration: Generated random vectors in the full unit cube to seed new
2. Local Exploitation: For F₂–F₅, applied ±0.1 coordinate perturbations around the
current best to capture directional gradients.
3. Selection: Submitted all candidates, recorded feedback, and chose the top-scoring
vector per function.
✅ Findings (What We Learned)
• F₂ & F₅ benefited substantially from larger jumps, escaping small local optima.
• F₃ & F₄ responded predictably to ±0.1 tweaks, indicating moderately smooth
landscapes.
• F₁ & F₇ remained unchanged, confirming we faced very noisy or flat surfaces.
✅ Adjustments (How We Adapted)
• Round 6 plan: Shrink perturbation magnitude to ±0.05 for finer granularity.
• Increase random-sample budget for F₁ and F₇ in upcoming rounds.
• Standardize our logging pipeline (inputs + scores) to feed into the surrogate-
modeling phase.
Round 2
Strategy Type: Manual Exploration & Dimensional Validation
Focus: Systematic coordinate-wise testing
Methods Used:
• Perturbed each input coordinate by ±0.10 around our baseline vectors for F₁–F₈
• Submitted the full batch of shifted vectors and recorded the returned scores
Model Used: None
Overview
In Round 2, we aimed to establish which dimensions of each black-box function were most
sensitive. Starting from our initial midpoint guesses, we generated two variants per coordinate—
one with +0.10 and one with –0.10—and submitted all of them at once. The feedback gave us a
coarse sensitivity map to guide finer searches in subsequent rounds.

🔍 RAFA Summary – Round 2 Observations Journey
✅ Reason (Why We Did It)
Round 1 confirmed our submission pipeline but left us blind to input–output relationships. Coarse
perturbations were needed to reveal which dimensions and functions were most impactful.
✅ Approach (What We Did)
1. Candidate Generation: For each function, created two variants per coordinate by
adding/subtracting 0.10.
2. Batch Submission: Sent all perturbed vectors in a single round and logged scores.
3. Selection: Chose the highest-scoring vector for each function.
✅ Findings (What We Learned)
• F2 & F5 exhibited the largest score swings, indicating strong coordinate sensitivity.
• F4 & F6 showed moderate, consistent responses, suggesting smoother
landscapes.
• F1, F3 & F7 remained nearly flat or noisy, highlighting the need for broader
exploration.
✅ Adjustments (How We Adapted)
• In Round 3, shifted to ±0.05 micro-perturbations around the best vectors for finer
tuning.
• Introduced random exploratory injections for plateau functions (F1, F7) to escape
flat regions.

Round 3
Strategy Type: Mixed Local Perturbation & Random Exploration
Focus: Breaking plateaus and probing sensitivity
Methods Used: ±0.05 coordinate perturbations for sensitive functions + random sampling for flat
ones
Model Used: None (manual parsing & tabulation code)
Overview
In Round 3, we combined targeted local tweaks around our then-best vectors with purely random
injections for functions that had shown little movement (notably F1 and F7). We submitted this
mixed pool of candidates and parsed the very first feedback scores for each function.

🔍 RAFA Summary – Round 3 Observations Journey
✅ Reason (Why We Did It)
Rounds 1–2 gave us initial footholds but left several functions (especially F1 & F7) stuck with
negligible change. We needed a hybrid of exploitation (fine local tweaks) and exploration (random
jumps) to escape flat regions and reveal sensitive dimensions.
✅ Approach (What We Did)
1. current best vector.
Candidate Generation: Generated ±0.05 perturbations around each function’s
2. Exploratory Sampling: Injected purely random vectors for plateau functions (F1, F7)
to seed new regions.
3. Submission & Parsing: Submitted the pooled candidates, then loaded and sliced
observations3.txt to capture the first eight scores.
✅ Findings (What We Learned)
improvements.
• F2–F6 responded positively to local perturbations, yielding measurable score
• F4 was highly sensitive: small tweaks led to large score swings.
• F1 & F7 required broad random jumps to make any progress at all.
✅ Adjustments (How We Adapted)
• Increased random-sample budget for flat functions in subsequent rounds.
• Planned to refine perturbation magnitude (±0.02–0.03) for functions showing strong
local sensitivity.
• Standardized the parsing pipeline (as above) to enable seamless integration of
surrogate modeling in future rounds.

With Round 3’s lessons in hand, we were ready to layer in more sophisticated surrogates and
evolutionary search methods starting in Round 4.
Round 4
Strategy Type: Surrogate-Guided CMA-ES (for F6) + Tuned Perturbations
Focus: Hybrid surrogate modeling and targeted micro-adjustments
Methods Used:
• CMA-ES on F6 (seeded with our best known vector)
• ±0.03 coordinate tweaks for F1–F5, F7–F8
• Selective random injections for plateauing functions (F1, F7)
Model Used: Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) + manual perturbations
Overview
In Round 4, we paired our existing local-search tactics with a powerful optimizer for moderate-
dimensional functions. We ran CMA-ES on F6 to rapidly home in on its optimum, while continuing
score-driven micro-perturbations (±0.03) for the remaining functions. Random samples were still
injected for the flattest landscapes to keep exploration alive.

🔍 RAFA Summary – Round 4 Observations Journey
✅ Reason (Why We Did It)
By the end of Round 3 we’d squeezed all gains from simple tweaks and random jumps. We
needed a more principled optimizer to push F6—our most responsive moderate-dimensional
function—while still refining others.
✅ Approach (What We Did)
1. CMA-ES on F6: Launched a CMA-ES run in the 5-D space of F6, using our top
vector as the starting mean.
2. Micro-Perturbations: Applied ±0.03 adjustments to each dimension of the best-
known vectors for F1–F5, F7–F8 to capture local improvements.
3. Random Injections: Added a handful of purely random vectors for F1 and F7 to
escape flat or noisy regions.
✅ Findings (What We Learned)
• F6 jumped to a new best, validating CMA-ES for medium-dimensional landscapes.
• F4 and F5 continued to yield gains under moderate tweaks, confirming smooth,
well-behaved surfaces.
• F1 and F7 remained largely unchanged, highlighting the need for more aggressive
exploration or alternative modeling.

Round 5
Strategy Type: Focused Perturbation on Known Good Vectors
Focus: Stability testing on top performers
Methods Used: Systematic coordinate‐wise perturbations around previous best vectors
Model Used: None
Overview
In Round 5, we built on Rounds 1–4 by applying stable, systematic perturbations around our then
best‐known vectors. Rather than purely exploratory sampling, we generated candidate vectors by
making small, controlled adjustments (±0.01–0.05) to each coordinate of the current leaders,
focusing on refining promising regions and confirming that improvements weren’t due to noise.

🔍 RAFA Summary – Round 5 Observations Journey
✅ Reason (Why We Did It)
After initial exploration and local perturbations, we needed to verify that our best vectors were
indeed genuine improvements and not artifacts of noise.
✅ Approach (What We Did)
1. Candidate Generation: For each function F₁–F₈, applied fine‐grained tweaks
(±0.01–0.05) around the current top vector.
2. Evaluation: Submitted this refined candidate set and recorded the scores.
3. Selection: Retained the single highest‐scoring vector per function for the next
round.
✅ Findings (What We Learned)
• F2–F5 showed clear sensitivity to fine‐tuned inputs, confirming that precise
adjustments could yield gains.
• F1 remained extremely low, suggesting a very flat or highly noisy landscape.
• F7 and F8 improved modestly but plateaued, indicating the need for broader
exploration.
✅ Adjustments (How We Adapted)
• Increased random‐sampling injections for plateau functions (F1, F7) in Round 6.
• Planned to combine structured perturbations with pocket random injections in
upcoming rounds.
• Standardized our perturbation pipeline and logging to feed into surrogate‐guided
approaches later.

### Overview
In Round 6, we transitioned from random guessing to a disciplined local search. For each function
F₁–F₈, we generated candidate vectors by adding/subtracting 0.05 to each coordinate of our then-
best vectors, and for plateauing functions (F₁, F₇) we injected a handful of random points to probe
broader regions.

### 🔍 RAFA Summary – Round 6 Observations Journey
✅ **Reason (Why We Did It)**
By Round 5 our exploratory injections had mapped rough landscapes but lacked systematic local
refinement. We needed a structured way to probe the immediate neighborhoods of our highest‐
potential vectors.
✅ **Approach (What We Did)**
1. **Candidate Generation:** For each function, created ±0.05 perturbations around the current
best vector.
2. **Random Injections:** For F₁ and F₇—functions that showed minimal response—we added a
small set of purely random vectors in [0,1]ᵈ to escape flat regions.
3. **Submission & Selection:** Submitted the combined candidate pool, recorded the scores, and
picked the single top performer per function.
✅ **Findings (What We Learned)**
- **F2 & F5** showed modest gains (Δscore ≈ +10%).
- **F4** responded strongly to local tweaks, confirming high sensitivity.
- **F1, F3 & F7** remained largely unchanged, indicating flat or highly noisy regions.
✅ **Adjustments (How We Adapted)**
- Increased random‐sample budget for flat functions in Round 7.
- Planned to **shrink perturbation magnitude** (to ±0.02–0.03) for sensitive functions in Round 8.
- Standardized logging of vectors and scores to feed into our upcoming surrogate‐guided
pipeline.
## Round 7
**Overview**
In Round 7 we introduced a **Perturbation + Random Sampling** strategy to break through the
plateaus we’d seen in earlier rounds. For each function, we generated new candidate vectors by:
1. **Local perturbation** around our current best-known vectors (±0.05 per coordinate).
2. **Random exploratory sampling** in the full unit cube for functions that showed little
improvement (e.g. F1, F7).
This allowed us to both refine promising regions and explore new areas simultaneously.

✅ **Reason (Why We Did It)**
By the end of Round 6, several functions (notably F1 and F7) had stalled at very poor scores. We
needed a way to *escape* these local plateaus and continue our search.
✅ **Approach (What We Did)**
1. **Local perturbations**: Tweaked each coordinate of our best vectors by ±0.05 to probe
immediate neighborhoods.
2. **Random sampling injections**: For plateauing functions, sampled extra random vectors in [0,
1]ᵈ to seed new regions.
3. **Selection**: Combined the top performers from both streams for our next submission.
✅ **Findings (What We Learned)**
- Random injections gave F2 and F5 a noticeable boost, escaping small local optima.
- F1 and F3 remained essentially flat—indicating very “noisy” or “flat” landscapes.
- F4’s dramatic negative score confirmed high sensitivity to initial coordinates.
✅ **Adjustments (How We Adapted)**
- Increased random-sample budget for flat functions in Round 8.
- Planned to refine perturbation magnitude (±0.01–0.03) based on per-function sensitivity.
- Documented dimensional sensitivities to guide our hybrid GP + GA approach in later rounds.

### Overview
In Round 8, we leveraged all feedback up to Round 7 to perform score-driven, fine-grained
perturbations around our best-known vectors. By adjusting each dimension by ±0.01–0.03 and
reviewing direct instructor feedback, we systematically nudged candidates toward local optima

rounds.
## Round 9
**Strategy Type:** Hybrid GP Surrogate + Genetic Algorithm & Proposal Sampling
**Focus:** Surrogate‐guided exploration in native function dimensions
**Methods Used:** GP regression (RBF) + GA hyperparameter tuning + per‐function Matern+White
GP + large‐scale random sampling
**Model Used:** GaussianProcessRegressor (RBF → Matern+WhiteKernel) n Round 9 we moved
beyond purely manual tweaks and local sampling by building **surrogate models** of each black‐
box function and using them to propose new candidates. We first trained a global 8-D GP (RBF
kernel) and ran a GA (pop=100, gen=30) to explore hyperparameter settings. Then, for each
function F1–F8, we:
1. Retrained a GP surrogate with **Matern(ν=1.5)+WhiteKernel** on its native dᶠ-dimensional
data.
2. Sampled **5 000** random points in [0, 1]ᵈᶠ and predicted their scores.
3. Selected the **top 10** by predicted value and chose the single best per function.
This “proposal engine” balanced exploitation of known good regions with broad exploration,
yielding one high‐confidence vector per function for submission.

### 🔍 RAFA Summary – Round 9
✅ **Reason (Why We Did It)**
By Rounds 7–8 we had manual perturbations and local sampling pipelines, but lacked a principled
model of the landscapes. Round 9’s goal was to **learn** surrogate approximations and use them
to guide global search.
✅ **Approach (What We Did)**
- **Data Prep:** Parsed & cleaned all past `InputVec`→numeric arrays, ensured ≥5 samples per
function.
- **Global GP+GA:** Trained an 8-D GP (RBF) on (X, y), ran GA (pop=100, gen=30) to explore
kernel hyperparams.
- **Per‐Function Surrogates:** For each Fᶠ, retrained a GP with Matern+White on its dᶠ-D data.
- **Proposal Sampling:** Drew 5 000 random points in [0, 1]ᵈᶠ, predicted scores, and ranked
them─top 10 per function.
- **Final Selection:** Chose the highest‐predicted vector per function for submission.
✅ **Findings (What We Learned)**
- **Global GP struggled** (negative R²), but **per‐function GPs** produced coherent relative
rankings.
- GA hyperparameter tuning gravitated to very small length‐scales—suggesting noisy local fit.
- Random sampling in each function’s native dimension **surfaced vectors** that outperformed
pure chance and manual tweaks.
✅ **Adjustments (How We Adapted)**
- Swapped RBF for **Matern+WhiteKernel** to handle rough/noisy behavior.
- Evolved from global GA fitting to a **“proposal engine”**—massive random sampling + surrogate
ranking.
- Streamlined parsing & sampling code to guarantee correct dᶠ-dimensional proposals.
Round 10
Strategy Type: Integrated Surrogate-Guided Optimization with Clean Data Augmentation
Focus: Full exploitation of historical data (Rounds 0–9) and new initial data (Batch 2)
Methods Used:
• Per-function GP+Matern+WhiteKernel surrogates, retrained on the expanded datasets
• Expected Improvement (EI) acquisition for exploitation-amenable functions (F2–F6, F8)
• Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) for plateau/noisy functions (F1, F7)
• Per-function strict dimension enforcement, clean data pipelines
Overview
In Round 10, we corrected our approach by integrating all historical queries and scores from
Rounds 0–9 with the newly provided batch of initial data, ensuring complete surrogate retraining
per function. We implemented strict function-specific pipelines, avoiding contamination and
ensuring correct dimensional suggestions for every function.
Functions F1 and F7 continued to be addressed through broad LHS exploration due to their
flatness, while F2–F6, F8 used EI-driven proposals leveraging the updated surrogate models.

🔍 RAFA Summary – Round 10 Observations Journey
✅ Reason (Why We Did It)
Recognizing the shortcomings of prior rounds (contamination risks, dimension mismatches), we
transitioned to a fully clean and isolated pipeline, ensuring all functions leveraged both the past
data and the new initial data correctly. This allowed us to update surrogates and apply function-
specific strategies reliably.
✅ Approach (What We Did)
1. Data Consolidation & Cleaning
◦ Combined Rounds 0–9 queries and scores.
◦ Appended the second batch of initial data per function.
◦ Verified and enforced correct dimensions per function input space.
2. Model Retraining & Candidate Generation
◦ Retrained per-function surrogates on the expanded data.
◦ Applied EI acquisition for F2–F6, F8.
◦ Applied broad LHS for F1, F7.
3. Validation & Submission Preparation
◦ Implemented strict validation to ensure dimension correctness and clean query
formatting.
✅ Findings (What We Learned)
• F2–F6, F8 remained responsive to surrogate-based proposals.
• F1, F7 continued to show flat behavior, requiring exploration-first strategies.
• Our revised clean pipeline ensured dimension correctness and compliance.
✅ Adjustments (How We Adapted)
• Transitioned to per-function isolated data pipelines.
• Eliminated all globals and reused lists.
• Hardcoded query suggestion steps with strict validation.
Strategy Type: Advanced Surrogate-Guided Ensemble Optimization
Focus: Full data consolidation, ensemble model validation, and proposal refinement
Methods Used:
• Combined historical (Rounds 0–10) and clean data for retraining
• Per-function Gaussian Process surrogates (Matern + WhiteKernel)
• Expected Improvement (EI) acquisition for F2–F6, F8
• Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) for F1 and F7
• Strict dimension enforcement and final output validation
Overview
In Round 11
, we executed our most complete and validated pipeline yet. We retrained all per-function surrogates
on the consolidated dataset (including Round 10 feedback and second-batch initial inputs),
enforced clean dimension handling, and used Expected Improvement (EI) or LHS depending
on each function’s response history. We validated all outputs thoroughly, ensuring that every
proposed query met formatting and dimension constraints.

• Used LHS exploration for flat-response functions F1, F7
3. Validation & Submission
• Enforced dimension correctness per function
• Verified submission formatting via automated checks
✅ Findings (What We Learned)
• Functions F2–F6 and F8 benefited significantly from EI-guided suggestions
• Functions F1 and F7 remained flat; exploration-heavy strategies performed best
• Surrogates trained on all past + clean data were robust and generalizable
✅ Adjustments (How We Adapted)
• Integrated surrogate ensemble techniques and validated on multiple kernels
• Standardized all submission format generation
• Finalized clean, validated vectors for submission with no reformatting needed
## Round 12 Observations Journey
✅ **Reason** (Why We Did It)
Building on our Round 11 insights, we locked in our strongest performers from Round 10 and
injected both global (LHS) and local (micro-step) perturbations to capture any nearby
optima—while keeping dimensionality constraints strict.
✅ **Approach** (What We Did)
1. **Baseline Selection**
• Identified the single best vector from our Round 10 submission for each F1–F8.
2. **Candidate Generation**
- **F1 & F7 (flat-response)**: 3 random LHS samples + the Round 10 best.
- **F2–F5 (stable best)**: Locked in the Round 10 best with no new exploration.
- **F6 (5-D)**: Baseline + two micro-step adjustments (+0.03 in coordinate 1 and +0.03 in
coordinate 5).
- **F8 (8-D)**: Baseline + two micro-step adjustments (+0.03 in coordinate 1 and +0.03 in
coordinate 2).
3. **Export**
- **formatted_submission.txt**: One vector per function (first candidate).
- **candidate_review.txt**: All 4–5 candidates per function for offline review.
✅ **Findings** (What We Learned)
- **F2–F5** remained most performant at their Round 10 best—no nearby improvements found.
- **F6 & F8** showed slight gains from micro-step perturbations in some dimensions, indicating
local curvature.
- **F1 & F7** flat-response behavior persisted; random LHS exploration did not beat baseline.
- Our candidate review file helped us spot near-baseline variants for potential ensembling.
✅ **Adjustments** (How We Adapted)
- Standardized micro-step size (±0.03) across vector entries for local search consistency.
- Enforced one-per-function in the final submission to satisfy Round 12 format.
- Prepared **candidate_review.txt** to hand off our top vectors per function for future rounds or
ensemble testing.
Round 12
Strategy Type: Hybrid Local Refinement & Focused Exploration
Focus: Lock in strongest known vectors and inject targeted micro-perturbations to explore local
optima
Methods Used:
• Selected single best vector from Round 10 for each function as baseline
• Added Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) exploration for flat-response functions (F1, F7)
• Performed ±0.03 micro-step perturbations on sensitive coordinates for F6 and F8
• Locked in Round 10 best vectors for stable functions (F2–F5) without new exploration
Model Used: None (score-driven manual search augmented by systematic perturbations)
⸻
Overview
In Round 12, we prioritized consolidating gains by focusing on our strongest performing vectors
from previous rounds. For the notoriously flat-response functions F1 and F7, we introduced
a small number of LHS random samples alongside the Round 10 best to probe for new
optima. For functions known to be stable at their current best (F2 through F5), we chose to
keep the baseline vectors unchanged. For F6 and F8, which showed some potential local
curvature, we generated micro-step perturbations by adjusting key dimensions by ±0.03 to
capture nearby performance improvements.
This targeted approach aimed to balance exploitation of high-confidence vectors with exploration in
promising local neighborhoods while respecting dimensional constraints and the
competition’s single-vector submission requirement per function.
